2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (or Windows equivalent)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Currently none needed)

## How to Run

Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:
`python run.py`
